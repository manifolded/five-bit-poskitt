# cipher-grid

The python program genCipherGrid.py (in this directory) generates the Vigenere cipher key shown on pg. 63 of "The Secret L1fe of Codes" of the Murderous Maths series by Kjartan Poskitt.  

More precisely you can uncomment the appropriate line of code so that the output is in html, redirect that output to a file, open that file in a browser and then print it and make yourself a pretty nice looking copy of key from the book.  There is some extra code so that a blank line can be introduced making it easier to print an extra copy, then cut off its plaintext header and use that as the straight strip described on pg. 64.
